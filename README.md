```lrc
[00:30.42] Who am I?
[00:31.99] Am I not unique?
[00:34.31] Maybe I'm not here at all
[00:46.81] 
[00:37.24] Look, the fakers
[00:39.38] Blinding us with lies
[00:41.66] The breakers of us all
[00:52.66] 
[00:44.63] Oh, it's useless
[00:48.63] What could it mean that we're here? (What does it all mean?)
[00:52.28] Can we make a difference? (Can really make that difference?)
[00:56.39] If we don't break out of here?
[01:11.39] 
[00:59.20] Wake up, get up, get out there
[01:03.14] Raise your voice against liars
[01:06.77] Feed your anger like fire
[01:10.06] Why does nobody want change?
[01:24.06] 
[01:14.50] Just imagine you're out there
[01:18.23] Swatting lies in the makin'
[01:21.78] Can't move fast without breakin'
[01:24.79] If you hold on, life won't change
